# Transcriptomics
Transcriptomics projects I did during the course of transcriptomics of my master degree in bioinformatics at Polimi University

Bulk RNA Analysis:

In this project I performed an analysis on three different tissue samples each from three different patient to study and compare gene expression across the different samples

Single Cell RNA Analysis:

Starting from a dataset downloaded from PanglaoDB, I analysed the gene expression of the sample's cells to cluster them together according to their gene expression and indentifing gene markers to assign each cluster a cell type
